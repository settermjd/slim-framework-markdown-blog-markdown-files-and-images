It's hard to get away from cloud storage in modern web application development; and with good reason!

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providers such as _Amazon Web Services_, _Microsoft Azure_, _Google Cloud Platform_, and _Alibaba Cloud_ make storing data anywhere in the world almost trivial, regardless of programming language, operating system, and budget.

Whether you're storing instrumentation data from a Raspberry Pi-based weather station, or medical records for a nation-state, cloud providers are up to the task. However, they don't do everything for you. They wonâ€™t handle tasks such as only letting valid users store legitimate files.

So in this tutorial, you're going to learn how to use [Twilio's Verify API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/verify/api) to validate uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket in a [Slim framework](https://www.slimframework.com/) application which uses [the Twig templating engine](https://twig.symfony.com/) for the view templates.
